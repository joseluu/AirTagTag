# AirTagTag

This is a derivative of the AirTagTag project. It uses an EPS32 with a small oled display, detects the AirTag weared by my cat, 
displays its distance from the device or if the cat is out displays when it lost contact. When the cat is back in it displays the time in.

ESP32 AirTag Detector with Captive Portal -  Apple AirTag detection system using an ESP32. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scans / detects AirTags and other BLE devices, CAPTIVE PORTAL hosted by the ESP32. Dynamic updates, trends based on RSSI values device names and distances.

Key Features:

    Real-Time BLE Scanning: Continuously scans for BLE devices, specifically identifying AirTags.
    AirTag Detection Counter: Maintains a count of each detected AirTag, updating only when the device is within range.
    RSSI Trends: Displays RSSI trends with color coding:
        Red: Signal strength is increasing.
        Green: Signal strength is stable.
        Blue: Signal strength is decreasing.
    Device Distance Estimation: Calculates the approximate distance of the AirTag based on RSSI.
    Captive Portal:
        Lists all detected BLE devices with details.
        Displays AirTag detection counts and trends at the top.
        Accessible through the ESP32's WiFi hotspot.
    Clear and Reset: A button to clear all data and start fresh.
    Automatic Captive Portal: Opens automatically for easy access to device data.

Instructions:

    Hardware Requirements:
        ESP32 development board.
        BLE-enabled AirTags or other BLE devices for testing.
    Setup:
        Flash the provided firmware to your ESP32 using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE.
        Power the ESP32 and connect to the WiFi hotspot ESP32-BLE-Portal.
    Access the Portal:
        Open a browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1 (default IP address).
    View AirTag Details:
        Check the count, RSSI trends, and other details of detected AirTags.
    Clear Data:
        Use the "Clear" button to reset the detection counts and trends.

Enhancements:

    Dynamic Trend Updates: Tracks RSSI trends for proximity estimation.
    Device Details: Displays additional information like service UUIDs and names.
    Responsive Captive Portal: Dynamically updates device data without restarting.

How It Works:

    BLE Scanning:
        Runs continuously in a separate task.
        Detects devices with Apple manufacturer data (0x4C) to identify AirTags.
    Captive Portal:
        Uses ESPAsyncWebServer to serve data over a local network.
        Displays data dynamically with trends and counts.
    RSSI and Distance:
        RSSI values are used to estimate distance and calculate trends.

Future Improvements:

    Add historical graphs for RSSI trends.
    Enable JSON API for external integrations.
    Optimize memory management for larger device counts.

Dependencies:

    ESPAsyncWebServer
    AsyncTCP
    ESP32 BLE Arduino

Usage Scenarios:

    Track AirTag proximity and presence in a given area.
    Debugging and testing BLE devices.
    Educational projects to explore BLE technology.
